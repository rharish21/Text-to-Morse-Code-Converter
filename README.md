## Features

- **Text to Morse Conversion**: Converts any alphanumeric text into Morse code.
- **Morse to Text Decoding**: Decodes Morse code back into readable text.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple command-line interface for easy interaction.

## How It Works

The program uses a dictionary to map each alphanumeric character to its corresponding Morse code. It then processes the user's input to convert it into Morse code or decode Morse code back into text.

### Example:
- Input: `HELLO`
- Output: `.... . .-.. .-.. ---`
